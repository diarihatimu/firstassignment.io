Located in the Civic District, not only is Fort Canning Park a beautiful spot to seek respite from the busy city, it's also full of history and things to do. Planning a day out to explore Fort Canning during the weekend? We've got you covered with this guide! From historical spots like the Battlebox to Insta-worthy spots and halal food nearby, our guide is perfect for you!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center">Formerly known as Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill), Fort Canning was believed to be the site of palaces of 14th century ancient Singapore Kings. During British colonial rule in Singapore, it was where the governors lived and later on, it was used for military purposes. That explains why you'd be able to see remnants of fortifications and cannons in the park. Fort Canning was also the site where the British surrendered Singapore to the Japanese in World War II!</p>

<br>
  <p>Named after Sang Nila Utama, the legendary founder and first King of ancient Singapore, this garden was modelled after</p> 
  <p>ancient royal gardens back in the day. This might explain why the architecture here is reminiscent of Bali's famous Empul</p> 
  <p>Tirta Bali and Pura Lempuyang temples (the one with the famous gates of heaven)!</p>  

<br>
<br>
<p><b>Location:</b> Near Registry of Marriages and National Archives Singapore</p>

  <p>new F&B facilities.!</p>
