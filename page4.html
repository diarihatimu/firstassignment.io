  <h3>1. BADOQUE CAFÉ</h3>
<br>
<img src="Sample1/Badoque-Cafe-01.jpg" width="800" height="500">
<br>
  <p>The main reason to visit Badoque café is to badok (eat). From its tantalising spread of savoury dishes, go for their</p> 
  <p>signatures of the mouth-tingling Kepak Bing Bing (spicy chicken wings) and lamb shank to really enjoy the brand’s</p> 
  <p>characteristic rich flavours.</p>

<br>

<br>
<br>

  <p>The bestseller is the Badoque Ribs ($36), which gave us a bit of a shock, in a good way—it was 5cm thick and almost</p> 
  <p>as long as my arm. The accompanying brown sauce had a nice silky consistency helped by the addition of beef drippings</p> 
  <p>and jus. Meat is grilled well-done and served hot to your table with potatoes and greens. We suggest you share your</p> 
  <p>food with your loved ones — the portions are very generous.</p>

<br>
<img src="Sample1/image.jpg" width="800" height="600">
<br>

  <p>A mainstay with the Muslim café hopping crowd, Penny University has seen a burgeoning crowd over the years. Brimming</p> 
  <p>with students and adults alike, patrons hanker for hearty servings of smoky roasts and unique mains, with many downing a</p> 
  <p>helping of the café’s signature Muddy Espresso to complete their meal.</p>
